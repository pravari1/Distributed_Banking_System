Message communication:-
	Branch to branch communication done by sending it's length of name string and then name String bytes and then the BranchMessage(using writeDelimitedTo()).
	Controller does not have to send it's name before sending branch message.

Note:- All the branch messages should be sent via writeDelimitedTo() method.
